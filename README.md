The global COVID-19 pandemic makes tracking instances difficult. Fortunately, many websites report Covid-19 cases.
The Covid Cases Website covers global COVID-19 cases.

The Covid Cases Website tracks global Covid-19 cases, fatalities, and recoveries in real time.
To gain a better picture of a region, users can filter the data by country, region, or chronological range.

People should review all Covid cases worldwide. Covid had affected all company, stocks, and revenue around the world, causing a global recession. We shall know the specifics of each accident in our city. The website provides Covid first aid information.

The Covid 19 symptoms are on the homepage. I would like to add Covid case statistics, such as how many persons are infected, recovered, active, and dead. This is the Covid-affected population.

I'd like to give them immunisation dates so they may arrange appointments near their hotel.

I used COVID-19 API, a Restful API that provides real-time and historical coronavirus information, including total and active cases, number of tests, and deaths worldwide and by nation.
The API's three simple endpoints can be used to develop Covid-19 tracker websites and apps, predictive and forecasting algorithms, and more. Users can get a near-real-time coronavirus picture for their location by checking the statistics every 15 minutes.
The API is also designed for beginners. The COVID-19 API offers three basic endpoints for the following functions, unlike other services that offer several endpoints for sophisticated operations:

The Covid Cases Website's basic style makes it easy to find information.
Interactive maps and infographics on the website help users visualise the pandemic.

Code development utilised react.I initially found it difficult to use, but after some investigation, I learned everything I needed to build the website and produced a logo in Figma to improve our perspective.

Bootstrap with Redux Toolkit is a front-end programming framework for websites and online apps that allows responsive development.
The Covid-19 outbreak has spread all over the world, and it can be hard to keep track of how many cases there are. There are a lot of websites with up-to-date details on Covid-19 cases, which is good news.
One of these is the Covid Cases Website, which has a lot of information about Covid-19 cases around the world.

The Covid Cases Website shows the amount of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries due to Covid-19 around the world in real time.
Users can sort the data by country, region, or date range to learn more about what is going on in a certain place.

People will find it helpful to look at all of the Covid situations that are going around the world. Covid had an effect on every business, stock, and income in the world. As a result, there is a recession everywhere, and we will know the details of every accident that happened in our city or town. On the page, we can learn about first aid for Covid and how to take care of ourselves.

On the home page, I'd like to list the Covid 19's symptoms. I'd like to add data about the Covid cases, such as how many people get sick from the Covid and how many are cured, how many cases are still going on, and how many people have died. This is a list of the total number of people who were touched by the Covid.

In the future, I'd like to add the people's vaccination times so that they can schedule their appointment close to where they are staying.

I used the COVID-19 API, which is a Restful API that lets users get real-time and historical data about coronavirus, such as the total and active cases, number of tests done, and deaths around the world and at the country level.
The API is free to use and has three easy endpoints that can be used to build a wide range of apps, such as Covid-19 tracker websites and apps and machine learning models that can be used to build algorithms that can predict and predict the future. The data are updated every 15 minutes, so users can get a picture of the coronavirus in their area that is very close to real time.
Also, the API is set up in a way that makes it easy for first-time users to use. The COVID-19 API keeps things easy by only offering three simple endpoints that can be used to provide the following functions:

The Covid Cases website is easy to use and has a simple style that makes it easy for users to find the information they need quickly.
The website also has live maps and charts that show the data visually and make it easier for people to understand how big the pandemic is.

I used react to write the code.At first, it was hard for me to figure out how to use it, but I did some study and learned everything I needed to know to build a website. I also made a logo in Figma, which might change how we see it.

I've used boot strap and redux tool kit because it's a front-end development framework for making websites and web apps, and it lets me do flexible development.
