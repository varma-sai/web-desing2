The global COVID-19 pandemic makes tracking instances difficult. Fortunately, many websites report Covid-19 cases.
The Covid Cases Website covers global COVID-19 cases.

The Covid Cases Website tracks global Covid-19 cases, fatalities, and recoveries in real time.
To gain a better picture of a region, users can filter the data by country, region, or chronological range.

People should review all Covid cases worldwide. Covid had affected all company, stocks, and revenue around the world, causing a global recession. We shall know the specifics of each accident in our city. The website provides Covid first aid information.

The Covid 19 symptoms are on the homepage. I would like to add Covid case statistics, such as how many persons are infected, recovered, active, and dead. This is the Covid-affected population.

I'd like to give them immunisation dates so they may arrange appointments near their hotel.

I used COVID-19 API, a Restful API that provides real-time and historical coronavirus information, including total and active cases, number of tests, and deaths worldwide and by nation.
The API's three simple endpoints can be used to develop Covid-19 tracker websites and apps, predictive and forecasting algorithms, and more. Users can get a near-real-time coronavirus picture for their location by checking the statistics every 15 minutes.
The API is also designed for beginners. The COVID-19 API offers three basic endpoints for the following functions, unlike other services that offer several endpoints for sophisticated operations:

The Covid Cases Website's basic style makes it easy to find information.
Interactive maps and infographics on the website help users visualise the pandemic.

Code development utilised react.I initially found it difficult to use, but after some investigation, I learned everything I needed to build the website and produced a logo in Figma to improve our perspective.

Bootstrap with Redux Toolkit is a front-end programming framework for websites and online apps that allows responsive development.
[3:09 pm, 05/05/2023] Sairam UK: The resort website is essential for recruiting and maintaining tourists. A well-designed website can display the resort's amenities, services, and unique features while facilitating reservations.
This website was created to offer high-quality resorts to travellers who wish to enjoy their time.
Most people don't know about the resorts they wish to stay at, and if they come to a new area for an event and don't enjoy the ambience, it can depress them and influence their view of the place.
Resort websites are visually appealing and immersive, portraying the resort and its environs. 
High-quality photos, films, and graphics may convey the property's beauty and grandeur.
I also chose the website's colour scheme, font, and layout to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. I made a beautiful and effective website, so visitors stay longer and book.
I used violet, black, sky blue, and white.
Colours I used. Landing, home, and resort booking pages were designed. I used 60,20,20 colours.
User data includes name and email. Because if individuals are travelling from other locations to a new city and staying in the resort, I need to know the basic information to tell the person who knows them if something happens.

I used material ui and react. 

Web application framework React.js is popular. It lets developers build SEO-friendly, interactive components. React.js improves maintenance and productivity. React.js projects improve with Material UI integration.

Material-UI is a package that lets us import and use components to construct user interfaces in React apps. This saves developers a lot of time.
Google's UI concepts inspired Material-UI widgets. Developers can easily create visually appealing apps.

React is great for building interactive mobile, web, and other apps.
React's popularity is growing for good reason.

NumberList uses JavaScript (map function) in React. JSX is a simple HTML tag with no characteristics. The render function renders the HTML file's root element's NumberList component.

Traditional UI browser testing is difficult to setup. React testing requires little configuration.

React manages this beautifully. It avoids layout trashing, when the browser recalculates everything when the DOM element changes.


Website usability is crucial. Visitors should easily explore the site, obtain the information they need, and book their stay without hassle.
The website should have straightforward menus, navigation, and booking to do this. Since many people will use smartphones and tablets, the website should be mobile-friendly.
